# Depression-Data-analysis

## Introduction
This README provides a comprehensive summary of the data analysis performed on a dataset related to various factors that may contribute to depression. The dataset, named depression_data, includes a range of variables such as age, marital status, education level, lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption), medical history, and income levels. The goal of this analysis is to uncover insights, correlations, and patterns that could help in understanding the factors influencing mental health, particularly depression, and to identify key risk factors and trends within the dataset.
